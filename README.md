# Node-Screenshot-Bot
A simple bot made in Node.js that will take the screenshot of any valid website (made to be used with command line)

<strong>Current Version</strong>
<ul>
  <li> The -f command allows you to enter in the full URL (entered in before the URL) </li>
  <li> The -h command will tell you what the -f command does (because that is the only command) </li>
  <li> If there are no other arguments given, the bot will automatically enter in the 'https://www.' part of the URL </li>
</ul>

<strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>
<p> if you were thinking that this would be somewhat useful, but it didnt work for you, it is most likely my fault, this was made to teach myself nodejs and the puppeteer library for node, so it probably won't get updated frequently or at all.</p>
