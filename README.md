<ul>
  <li> The -f command allows you to enter in the full URL (entered in before the URL) </li>
  <li> The -h command will tell you what the -f command does (because that is the only command) </li>
  <li> If there are no other arguments given, the bot will automatically enter in the 'https://www.' part of the URL </li>
</ul>
